## Project Information 

We use workbook activities such as read range when automating simple actions using an excel file. The workbook activities do not open excel, and they can read excel files even on a machine that does not have excel installed. We build the data table using a build data table activity, and we create the columns within that activity. We use the Excel Process Scope, Use Excel file, and For Each Excel Row to iterate through the active excel file. We can add a row to a data table using the the Add Data Row activity, in this project we add a row by creating an ArrayRow with the values to be added.
